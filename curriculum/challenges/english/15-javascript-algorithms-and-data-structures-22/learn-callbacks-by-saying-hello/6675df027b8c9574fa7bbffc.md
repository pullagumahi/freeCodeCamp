# --description--

Now we are going to actually use the function we passed in earlier. Modify the return statement of `sayHello` to include 
a space and the output from calling the `retrievedName` function.  

The `retrievedName` variable can also be referred to as a `First-class function` as it a function
that is being treated as a variable. 

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js

function sayMyName()
{
  return "Quincy"; 
}

function sayHello(retrievedName)
{
  return "Hi"; 
}
